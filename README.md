# Euler project 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Problems

The first project I wrote with a TDD mentality. This allowed me to break down the problem and create the tests alongside creating the main program. However in the second project I wrote the main function program to get the result. I then wrote the tests after. This prevented me from having useful tests and didn't allow me to test things such as even numbers.
